    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a professionally qualified accountant with more than 27 years experience working at all levels of large and small finance departments. 
        I am a self starter and a team player but can also function independently and feel I can be a great asset to your company. 
        I have a passion for financial and business analytics with experience in Python programming and Structured Query Language (SQL). 
        I am also in the process of upgrading my skills by studying Machine Learning and Deep Learning for artificial intelligence. 
        I am fully bilingual in English and Afrikaans and have recently started learning French and Spanish in anticipation of immigrating from South Africa to North America.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include analyzing companies for possible investment in the stock market, martial arts, going to the gym, reading and I have a keen interest in developing my 
        computer skills in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
